# Identification-and-Analysis-of-Saccadic-Eye-Movements-using-Signal-Processing-and-Modeling
Welcome to our groundbreaking research, where we propose an innovative algorithm, SaccadeWaveDetect, for the detection of both normal and slow saccades. Saccades are rapid eye movements that involve a rotation of the eye from one angle to another. Our algorithm leverages the concept of modelling saccadic waveforms as piecewise-quadratic signals, offering a robust and efficient approach to saccade detection.

# What are saccades?
A saccade is a rapid, conjugate, eye movement that shifts the center of gaze from one part of the visual field to another.
The quantitative analysis of saccades in eye movement data unveils information associated with intention, cognition, and health status.
Abnormally slow saccades are indicative of neurological disorders and often imply a specific pathological disturbance.

## Objective
Our research proposes an algorithm that is effective for the detection of both normal and slow saccades.

The proposed algorithm is partly based on modelling saccadic waveforms as piecewise-quadratic signals.
During a saccade, the eye rotates from one angle to another. The angle as a function of time (as the eye rotates) exhibits a particular waveform as shown in Fig. 1.

This relationship between peak angular velocity and amplitude is known as the saccadic ‘main sequence’ .
